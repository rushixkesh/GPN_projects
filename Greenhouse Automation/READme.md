# Greenhouse Automation

## INTRODUCTION

In this project I've done greeenhouse automation simulation using wokwi simulator and Blynk cloud for displaying readings on web dashboard.

DHT22 sensor is used as input if the predefined readings are reached above the min limit in greenhouse then output devices will turn on for some duration to normalize internal parameters.

## WORKING

IF temprature <=50 and humdity <= 50 then it will turn on the device which is assinged to reduce the the temperature and humidity and Bynk will read output readings of temperature and humdity and will display changes on web/ mobile dashboard

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

- ESP32
- DHT 22 Temperature and Humidity sensor
- Jumper wires

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Bynk IoT or Arduino IoT cloud
