# IoT Home Automation

## INTRODUCTION

In this project I've done home automation simulation using wokwi simulator and Blynk cloud. 

This project will give idea about how to implement IoT technology in home to control various home electronic devices such as Lights, fans, water pump, Tv or any other devices by just clicking a button on mobile phone.

## WORKING

we will give input using blynk app by clicking a button then esp will turn on/off the output devices which is assinged to that button
